      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        I respect your privacy and take the protection of your personal data seriously.
        This Privacy Policy explains how I handle information when you visit and use
        <span class="highlight">Portfolio</span> (my personal website).
      </p>

      <h3>Information I collect</h3>
      <p>
        I do not actively collect, process, or store personal data of visitors.
        However, certain technical information (such as IP address, browser type, and
        general usage data) may be automatically collected by your browser or my hosting provider
        to ensure the basic functionality and security of the website.
      </p>

      <h3>Use of information</h3>
      <p>
        Any automatically collected information is used solely to maintain and improve
        the performance, functionality, and security of <span class="highlight">Portfolio</span>.
        I do not use your data for marketing, profiling, or commercial purposes.
      </p>

      <h3>Cookies</h3>
      <p>
        <span class="highlight">Portfolio</span> itself does not use cookies.
        However, third-party services or the hosting provider may rely on cookies for
        technical operation. You can manage or block cookies at any time via your browser settings.
      </p>

      <h3>Third-party services</h3>
      <p>
        This website may contain links to external websites.
        I am not responsible for the privacy practices or content of those external services.
        Visiting such sites is at your own discretion.
      </p>

      <h3>Data security</h3>
      <p>
        I take reasonable measures to protect your information.
        However, as with any online service, I cannot guarantee complete protection against all risks.
        Please use this website with that understanding.
      </p>

      <h3>Your rights</h3>
      <p>
        As a visitor, you have the right to request information about any personal data that
        may have been collected, as well as to request its correction or deletion where applicable.
        Since <span class="highlight">Portfolio</span> does not intentionally store personal data,
        such requests may be limited in scope.
      </p>

      <h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
      <p>
        I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in legal requirements
        or technical setup. Updates will be published on this page.
      </p>
